Tree cover segmentation in aerial images of Göttingen

This dataset comprises 38 images of 100x100m at a resolution of 10cm, collected 
by airplane. The images come from Göttingen and have four bands: red, green, 
blue and near infrared. The acquisition date is unknown. The labels come in the 
form of binary masks, 1 is tree cover and everything else is 0.

In case that the images look strange in QGIS, set the transparency band to None 
(double click on the image in the lower left layer browser, then click on 
transparency).
